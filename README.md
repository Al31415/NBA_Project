NBA Game Winner Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains code and data for predicting the winner of NBA games using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Players and their interactions during a game are modeled as a heterogeneous graph to capture intricate relationships and predict game outcomes effectively.

Overview

What is this project about?

The goal is to accurately predict NBA game winners using player statistics and interactions represented through graph structures. A heterogeneous graph model is employed, using nodes for players on both the home and visitor teams, and edges representing different types of player interactions (assists, blocks, steals, fouls, and rebounds).

Features
	•	Graph Representation: Clearly captures complex player interactions using heterogeneous graphs.
	•	Advanced ML Techniques: Utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced predictive performance.
	•	Interpretable Results: Enables deeper insights into key interactions that influence game outcomes.
	•	High Accuracy: Achieves 80% accuracy when predicting game outcomes from just the first half of play-by-play data.

Getting Started

Installation

Clone this repository and install the necessary packages:

git clone https://github.com/Al31415/NBA_Project.git
cd NBA_Project
pipenv install 
pipenv shell 

Data

Ensure the following CSV files are in the root directory:
	•	nba_regular_season_playbyplay_data.csv
	•	team_ids.csv

These contain the raw play-by-play data and team identifiers respectively. They can be collected using the data handling scripts. 

Training and Evaluation

To train the Graph Neural Network model, simply run:

python main.py

This script will:
	•	Load and preprocess the data
	•	Build a heterogeneous graph
	•	Train the GNN model
	•	Report validation accuracy

Accuracy

The current model achieves 80% accuracy in predicting NBA game outcomes using only first-half play-by-play data.

Key Components
	•	Heterogeneous Graph Model (gcn_nba_winner_hetero.py):
	•	Nodes: Players from home and visitor teams.
	•	Edges: Player interactions categorized by assists, blocks, steals, fouls, and rebounds.
	•	Output: Game winner prediction (binary classification).

Results

The model demonstrates strong performance, showing the effectiveness of modeling player interactions as a graph for game outcome prediction.
